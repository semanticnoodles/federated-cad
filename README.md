# Creating Collections as Data Using Federated Queries

This repository provides a series of **Jupyter notebooks** designed for performing **federated queries** across **Wikidata** and other **linked open data (LOD)** endpoints, with a focus on querying bibliographic and author-related data. These notebooks support our paper _[Insert working title here]_ and aim to present reproducible examples of query design strategies other than structured real-world use  in the digital humanities and library science domains.

### LOD Endpoints on Use

Leveraging Wikidata, the SPARQL queries we present are designed to retrieve data from the following endpoints:

\- `BNE`: **Biblioteca Nacional de España**, the Spanish National Library. <!-- add link to BNE SPARQL endpoint -->

\- `BNF`: **Bibliothèque nationale de France**, the National Library of France. <!-- add link to BNF SPARQL endpoint -->

\- `BVMC`: **Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes**, the Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library. <!-- add link to BVMC SPARQL endpoint -->

## Materials in this Repository

This project contains several sample Jupyter Notebooks pertaining to:

1.  **Query Building**, (4 examples) a query building workflow. Additionally [wikidata_map_viz](/Volumes/Research/federated-cad/notebooks/01-query-building/wikidata-map-viz.md) offers an example of exploratory query that can be run directly on the Wikidata SPARQL endpint, visualising the place of birth of the authors mapped as part of the Spanish Golden Age (`wd:Q530936`) provided by repositories National Library of Spain, the National Library of France and Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes. 
2.  **Single Autors Multiple Works** (2 examples) <!-- add explanation of the example -->
3.  **Multiple Authors Multiple Works** (1 example) <!-- add explanation of the example --> 

### Running the Notebooks with Binder

This project includes example Jupyter notebooks that you can run directly in your browser using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). Click the **Launch Binder** button below to start a live session:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hibernator11/federated-cad/HEAD)

Once Binder finishes loading you will see a file browser on the left-hand side that will allow you to navigate all the notebooks contained in this repository.

#### Tips for Using the Notebooks

-  To run all cells at once: click **“Cell” > “Run All”** from the top menu.
-  To step through cell-by-cell: use the ▶️ **Run** button at the top or next to each cell.
-  Feel free to **edit** code or markdown cells and re-run them — your changes are temporary and will not be saved once the session ends or times out (will not affect the repository structure).
